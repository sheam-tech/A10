                <h4>What are the differences between authorization and authentication?</h4>
                <p><strong> Answer:</strong><figure className="wp-block-table is-style-regular table-bordered table "><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Authentication</strong></td><td><strong>Authorization</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Authentication verifies who the user is.</td><td>Authorization determines what resources a user can access.</td></tr><tr><td>Authentication works through passwords, one-time pins, biometric information, and other information provided or entered by the user.</td><td>Authorization works through settings that are implemented and maintained by the organization.</td></tr><tr><td>Authentication is the first step of a good identity and access management process.</td><td>Authorization always takes place after authentication.</td></tr><tr><td>Authentication is visible to and partially changeable by the user.</td><td>Authorization isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by the user.</td></tr><tr><td>Example: By verifying their identity, employees can gain access to an HR application that includes their personal pay information, vacation time, and 401K data.</td><td>Example: Once their level of access is authorized, employees and HR managers can access different levels of data based on the permissions set by the organization.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
